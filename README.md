This repository contains a Perl code example demonstrating a common off-by-one error in array iteration. The `bug.pl` file shows the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.pl` provides the corrected version.  The error arises from incorrectly calculating the upper bound of the loop iterator, leading to accessing an index beyond the array's bounds. This example highlights the importance of careful array indexing in Perl.
